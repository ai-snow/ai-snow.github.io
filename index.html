                <p>Languages help us tell our stories; past, present, and future.</p>
                
                <p>Math is no exception to this and people may be surprised at how profound the stories told through Mathematics can be.</p>
    
                <p>Take the following equation from conditional probability:</p>
    
                $$
                \large\text{Probability of A and B}
                $$
                
                $$
                \large= \left(\text{Probability of A Given B}\right)*\left(\text{Probability of B}\right)
                $$
    
                <p>In equivalent traditional math notation:</p>
    
                $$
                \large P(A\cap B)=P(A|B)P(B)
                $$
    
                <p>\(A\) and \(B\) can be replaced by any statements, no exceptions.</p>
    
                <p>Let us say \(A\) is the event known as success and \(B\) is the event known as trying.</p>
    
                $$
                \large\text{Probability of trying and success}
                $$
    
                $$
                \large =\left(\text{Probability of success Given trying}\right)*\left(\text{Probability of trying}\right)
                $$
    
                <p>Notice that rearranging \(A\) and \(B\) on the left-hand side of the equation does not change the validity of the statement.</p>
    
                <p>In English, what does this equation tell us? Well, break it down:</p>
    
                <p>Probability of trying and succeeding is a measure of self-driven success.</p>
    
                <p>Probability of succeeding given that one tries is a measure of ability.</p>
    
                <p>Probability of trying is a measure of motivation.</p>
    
                <p>We can then write the equation equivalently in English as:</p>
                
                <h2>"Self-driven success is the product of ability and motivation"</h2>
    
                <p>Does this style of storytelling with Mathematics make you want to get your spelunking gear on and explore the caverns that are hidden from so many people?</p>
    
                <p>Welcome to the path less traveled and let The Good Matharitan&#8482; guide you into and through the landscape of Mathematics.</p>

                <h2>A Short Run-Down of Me</h2>
    
                <p>From preschool to post-grad, I can provide guidance anywhere in the journey into math.</p>
    
                <p>My background is in mathematical research, data science, software engineering, actuarial science, statistical modeling, private tutoring, and a host of other topics, in 10s of industries and every size of company.</p>
    
                <p>My hobbies are piano, woodworking, drawing, painting, wilderness backpacking, writing, volunteering, among many others.</p>
    
                <p>I am a proud Eagle Scout and distinguished leader earning the Beacon Award from the University of Texas of the Permian Basin for excellence in leadership and community service.</p>
    
                <p>I have a BS in Actuarial Science and Mathematics from University of Central Missouri, studied 3 years of engineering at Missouri University of Science and Technology, and an Associate of the Society of Actuaries (ASA).</p>
    
                <p>My current employment entails modeling general liability/casualty catastrophes resulting in mass tort litigations.</p>
    
                <p>Volunteer-wise, I currently provide oversight to ongoing quantum computing research and mathematical modeling competitions, and sit on Advisory Boards of university programs in mathematics. I also sit as an elected council member of the Entrepreneurial & Innovation Section of the Society of Actuaries.</p>
    
                <h2>The Good Samaritan of Math&#8482;</h2>

                <p class="hourly">Hourly rates depend on a case-by-case basis. Everyone has a custom plan. Special accomodations granted frequently. Discounts for bulk/weekly planned sessions. Problem-solving skills and fluency in math for all is my motivation and I hope to make this my primary career over time. In-person highly encouraged, hands-on, tactile learning emphasized.</p>
