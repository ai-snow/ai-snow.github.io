            Hello, my name is Sam Wehner.
            <br>
            I'm a problem solver.

            I am a seasoned <b>software professional</b> with experience in insurance, engineering, and data analytics.  I've developed state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, as well as a data model search engine and an algorithmic musical phrase generator.

            I am an <b>Associate of the Society of Actuaries</b> (ASA) and <b>Member of the American Academy of Actuaries</b> (MAAA).  I have in-depth experience developing actuarial data models and calculation engines.  For those who may not know, an actuary is a professional who quantifies and qualifies risk, usually financial risks.

            I have studied many fields of <b>engineering</b>, including Ceramic, Aerospace, and Mechanical, and focused on Geological studies over a summer.  I worked as an engineering intern for a few summers down in the oil fields of Western Texas and Western Oklahoma, mapping pipelines and programming Remote Terminal Units (RTUs).

            I have taught myself to play the <b>piano</b>, starting back in 2006.  Expressing myself through music is a key part of who I am.  Music ties it all together.
