        <h1>The Good Matharitan</h1>
        <p>Decentralized. Nano. Performant.</p>
        <p>Minimalist software built with intention.</p>
        <p>Knowledge compression through language.</p>
        <h2>The Ultimate Rabbit Hole</h2>
        <p>Language translation is not a one-to-one function. Some are more equipt to encode certain concepts more effectively.</p>
        <p>There are languages for music, conversation, mathematics, and computation, to name a few high-level categories.</p>
        <p>But, even within these categories are languages more adept at certain domain applications.</p>
        <p>The design of a language is directly related to what type of problems it can solve and which concepts are expressable.</p>
        <p>Does a population know a concept if it doesn't have a way of expressing it with language?</p>
        <p>The standard digital computer has a language of 0s and 1s which can be ordered in sequence to be interpreted as operations.</p>
        <p>Is there a language, or a set of languages, that when combined can describe everything, and not only from a physical perspective?</p>
        <p>This is not about predictability.</p>
        <p>This is about expressability.</p>
        <p>In the mature Information Age, do we have the right languages for the post-Information Age?</p>
        <p>I'd say no, not even close.</p>
        <h2>What's the problem with what we have?</h2>
        <h3>Inconsistency, for one.</h3>
        <p>Information needs to be consistent.</p>
        <p>Language without consistency has no meaning.</p>
        <p>Can language be logically consistent and fully expressive at the same time?</p>
        <p>The Earth is approximately a sphere.</p>
        <p>How do we know this statement is consistent with our view of reality?</p>
        <p>Most people know it wasn't considered true a few hundred years ago.</p>
        <p>What makes it considered true now?</p>
        <p>Does "Earth" still refer to the same object/subject?</p>
        <p>Does "sphere" still refer to a surface which every point on it is equidistant from the origin or a frame of reference?</p>
        <p>Does "approximately" still refer to the difference between two things being minimal in the current frame of reference?</p>
        <p>Can language be perpetually consistent?</p>
        <p>Or, rather, can a language be designed to be perpetually consistent?</p>
        <p>If not perpetually, can it be consistent at a given point in time, and can that consistency be understood consistently into the future, even though the language in the future may be different?</p>
        <p>Can we use a mathematical framework that tags timestamps to assignments?</p>
        <p>Can natural language be constructed in the same way?</p>
        <p>$$\text{The Earth is approximately a sphere} = true$$</p>
        <p>$$f(now, \text{The Earth is approximately a sphere}) \rightarrow true$$</p>
        <p>Where \(f(t, statement)\) returns whether or not a statement is consistent at time \(t\).</p>
        <p>Why am I concerned with consistency and not truth?</p>
        <p>Truth is very hard to show, especially through language.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, local consistency is necessary for language to mean anything.</p>
        <p>Without consistency, truth cannot be expressed or communicated.</p>
        <p>If I have my own personal language that no other person understands, how do I communicate with others?</p>
        <p>Knowledge becomes siloed.</p>
        <p>There may be groups of people debating different topics, but if the underlying language is inconsistent between groups, what is the point of debate?</p>
        <p>How do we let the future know what was the true definitions of things/concepts?</p>
        <p>How can a decentralized system continue if communication between individuals is not consistent?</p>
        <p>Changes in communication protocol has to diffuse through the system, but if everyone is diffusing their own protocol, the system dies eventually.</p>
        <p>Humans are not inherently centrally controlled; central control is imposed on us, whether that is good or bad, whatever your opinion.</p>
        <p>We still communicate and behave in a decentralized manner.</p>
        <p>Central control mechanisms only influence our decentralized behavior.</p>
        <p>How can central control mechanisms communicate consistently to everyone if everyone is not being consistent between themselves?</p>
        <p>“Tradition is not the worship of ashes, but the preservation of fire.” - Gustav Mahler</p>
        <p>Language is a tradition.</p>
        <p>Changes to a tradition cannot be so big that they snuff out the "fire" of the tradition.</p>
        <p>New logs need to be added to a fire for it to be sustained, but if those logs are too big (among other things), that fire will not be sustained.</p>
        <p>This is a rather important concept to grasp.</p>
        <p>To sustain a "fire" or tradition, there has to be both conservatism and liberalism (classical).</p>
        <p>The liberal says "hey, we need to add this log or the fire will go out soon."</p>
        <p>The conservative says "well, that log will snuff out the fire, I think this other log will be more suitable."</p>
        <p>If liberals and conservatives can't communicate, the fire is not maintained properly and everyone is left with nothing.</p>
        <p>That is why consistency in language is the most important concept in a decentralized system, especially a dynamic one.</p>
        <p>Let's make a psychological analogy here.</p>
        <p>There's the theory of the ego and the superego.</p>
        <p>The superego is sometimes described as the "inner-critic".</p>
        <p>Psychologists say we need to tame this inner identity.</p>
        <p>The ego needs to be developed in a healthy way, but those growing up in a traumatic household tend to not develop an ego, they say, and are controlled by the superego entirely.</p>
        <p>Here's the analogy:</p>
        <p>The extremes on the ends (extreme-conservatism, extreme-liberalism) are like the superegos of the two groups.</p>
        <p>Whereas the non-extremists are more like the egos of the groups.</p>
        <p>If the two camps are themselves a form of consciousness (group-think), then taming the extremes is paramount.</p>
        <p>If their superegos are given control and primary communication filtering, then it is as though our collective consciousnesses have been traumatized.</p>
        <p>Can such a state of affairs be alleviated through group-on-group discourse?</p>
        <p>Probably not. There needs to be another collective consciousness that comes along to mediate them and bring the egos back into power.</p>
        <p>Let's eventually discuss this "other consciousness," but less move to something else that is a problem.</p>
        <h3>Language today is not continuous, as well.</h3>
        <p>At a maximum, it is piecewise coninuous with the addition of mathematics.</p>
        <p>Biologically speaking, intuitively distinguishing objects into specific characteristics has an evolutionary advantage in a primitive society.</p>
        <p>If you are male looking to reproduce, it is fairly advantageous to identify a reproductive partner as female.</p>
        <p>This is a very valid and useful use of discrete thinking.</p>
        <p>Decisions are usually applied in definite categorical fashion.</p>
        <p>You either do something or you don't.</p>
        <p>But, sometimes we can partially do something, in some sense.</p>
        <p>Stock traders can make fuzzy-like decisions with their investments in that they can put different percentages of their wealth in different assets.</p>
        <p>Portfolios can be described in ways such as 50% in category A and 50% in category B.</p>
        <p>Although we 100% made trades of the stock A and stock B, we participate in both price movements in a partial fashion.</p>
        <p>This hints at a way of making decisions that are less binary (yes/no).</p>
        <p>But it is still discrete categories.</p>
        <p>In the stock case, there are discrete stocks, so this makes sense; there's not a continuous spectrum of stocks to choose from.</p>
        <p>How many concepts in the real world can be categorized continuously?</p>
        <p>Well, there's the \(time\) category, which is continuous.</p>
        <p>Our exact moment in birth is a timestamp within the continuous spectrum of time.</p>
        <p>Temporal events tend to be within a continous time spectrum (although this assumes there is not a fundamental smallest time-step, but let's assume time is indeed continuous).</p>
        <p>Color is a continous spectrum that we rarely utilize in a continuous fashion (in a daily usage reference).</p>
        <p>Context usually decides how specific we are, but we don't go around saying the wavelengths of objects.</p>
        <p>And for fairly good reason: we biologically cannot output this information biologically.</p>
        <p>Our input of color information is virtually continuous, but our output, or are way of sharing color information is mostly not continuous.</p>
        <p>What I mean by "mostly" is that we could trial-and-error our way using paints or tools to get to a close representation in a continuous spectrum and tell people how to replicate this color using our findings.</p>
        <p>How important the precision is depends on the situation, but in everyday conversation we simply do not have time to bother constructing a continuous representation.</p>
        <p>We perform a clustering process in our brains to facilitate efficient communication.</p>
        <p>In many respects, this clustering is quite rational.</p>
        <p>The question to ask is how the loss in precision is compounded over time.</p>
        <p>Metaphorically speaking, if the compound factor is \(1\), then there is no need to be concerned.</p>
        <p>But any compound factor greater than \(1\) yields chaotic behavior eventually within interactions of other compounding factors.</p>
