            <p>Languages help us tell our stories; past, present, and future.</p>
            
            <p>Math is no exception to this and people may be surprised at how profound the stories told through mathematics can be.</p>

            <p>Take the following equation from conditional probability:</p>

            $$
            \text{Probability of A and B} = \left(\text{Probability of A Given B}\right)*\left(\text{Probability of B}\right)
            $$
            
            $$
            P(A\cap B)=P(A|B)P(B)
            $$

            <p>\(A\) and \(B\) can be replaced by any statements, no exceptions.</p>

            <p>Let us say \(A\) is the event known as success and \(B\) is the event known as trying.</p>

            $$
            \text{Probability of trying and success}=\left(\text{Probability of success Given trying}\right)*\left(\text{Probability of trying}\right)
            $$

            <p>Notice that rearranging \(A\) and \(B\) on the left-hand side of the equation does not change the validity of the statement.</p>

            <p>In English, what does this equation tell us? Well, break it down:</p>

            <p>Probability of trying and succeeding is a measure of self-driven success.</p>

            <p>Probability of succeeding given that one tries is a measure of ability.</p>

            <p>Probability of trying is a measure of motivation.</p>

            <p>We can then write the equation equivalently in English as:</p>
            
            <h2>"Self-driven success is the product of ability and motivation"</h2>

            <p>Does this style of storytelling with Mathematics make you want to get your spelunking gear on and explore the caverns that are hidden from so many people?</p>

            <p>Welcome to the path less traveled and let The Good Matharitan guide you into and through the landscape of mathematics.</p>
