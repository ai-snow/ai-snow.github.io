            Hello, my name is Sam Wehner.
            <br>
            I'm a problem solver.

            I am a seasoned <b>software professional</b> with experience in insurance, engineering, and data analytics.  I've developed state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, as well as a data model search engine and an algorithmic musical phrase generator.

            I am an <b>Associate of the Society of Actuaries</b> (ASA) and <b>Member of the American Academy of Actuaries</b> (MAAA).  I have in-depth experience developing actuarial data models and calculation engines.  For those who may not know, an actuary is a professional who quantifies and qualifies risk, usually financial risks.

            I have studied many fields of <b>engineering</b>, including Ceramic, Aerospace, and Mechanical, and focused on Geological studies over a summer.  I worked as an engineering intern for a few summers down in the oil fields of Western Texas and Western Oklahoma, mapping pipelines and programming Remote Terminal Units (RTUs).

            I have taught myself to play the <b>piano</b>, starting back in 2006.  Expressing myself through music is a key part of who I am.  Music ties it all together.  <a href="mp3/ForbiddenKey.mp3">Here</a> is a recording of a piece I wrote called Forbidden Key.

            <b>Photography</b> is a passion of mine.  Going to the botanical gardens and taking pictures of the plants and wildlife is a usual adventure when I'm travel about.

            I am an avid <b>woodworker</b>, as well.  Building furniture and creating musical instruments are a couple of things I enjoy building in my free time.  Below is a picture of the crib I designed and built for my daughter:
